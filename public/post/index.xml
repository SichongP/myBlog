      <description>I was assisting a bioinformatics workshop for FAANG group at Plant and Animal Genome (PAG) and I ran into an interesting question with an example provided by one of the instructors on the topic of Linux output redirecting. Take a look at this simplified example script print_stderr.sh:
#!/usr/bin/bash echo &amp;quot;first line of stderr&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /dev/stderr echo &amp;quot;second line of stderr&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /dev/stderr echo &amp;quot;third line of stderr&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /dev/stderr echo &amp;quot;A line of stdout&amp;quot;  Now if we redirect the stderr of this script to a file, instead of all three lines of stderr messages, we only see the last line!</description>

      <title>How to run snakemake pipeline on HPC</title>

      <description>Why use Snakemake on HPC Snakemake is a handy workflow manager written in Python. It handles workflow based on predefined job dependencies. One of the great features of Snakemake is that it can manage a workflow on both a standalone computer, or a clustered HPC system. HPC, or &amp;ldquo;cluster&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s often referred to, requires additional considerations.
On HPC, all computing jobs should be submitted to &amp;ldquo;compute nodes&amp;rdquo; through a workload manager (for example, Slurm).</description>

      <title>What is ChROseq and how does it work</title>

      <description>At the moment of writing this post, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on the plane flying to Cornell. There I will learn a beautiful technique called Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing, or ChRO-seq.
Thirteen hours of travel is getting to the point of breaking my soul &amp;ndash; I have finished most of work I can comfortablely do with one screen on a samll laptop. So I decided to write down what I know so far about ChRO-seq in preparation for my upcoming training tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you have ever written a scientific paper in MS Word (or any other word processing software) then you&amp;rsquo;re probably experienced frustrations like me: Word constantly crashing when loaded with too many high-resolution figures, citations getting messed up when working with others that use different citation managers, or hard to keep track of hundreds of versions of the draft, etc.
Of course, Latex is always an excellent solution to all those problems.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis testing and multiple test correction</title>

      <description>Why multiple testing correction? Multiple testing refers to a practice where we apply the same statistical test independantly multiple times. This raises a problem that’s related to hypothesis testing: the more independant tests we do, the more inflated our false positive rate becomes. Here I’m gonna use a simple example to explain why multiple testing correction is crucial for hypothesis testing.

      <description>Table of content  Table of content What Are Haplotype and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Quantify LD  Linkage Disequilibrium Coefficient ($D$): Standardized Linkage Disequilibrium Coefficient ($D&amp;rsquo;$) Correlation coefficient ($\gamma^2$)  Now why do we care about LD and haplotype?  LD is an indication of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.   This is the first post of my QE prep series. I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking notes on my study for general knowledge section of my QE.</description>

      <title>Split a FASTA record by Ns</title>

      <description>I want to split sequences in a fasta file at Ns.
Here is what an example file looks like:
&amp;gt;1_name ACGTTGCGGCATTCGATCGACGATCGATGCAAACGGTCACGGACTGACTGT ACACACGTAGCAGCATCAGCATNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGTTGGACGG NNNNNNNNNNNNGGTGACACACGAGATATATFAGATCAACGTAAGGGATGA NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN AGTCGCTAGCATGCATGGCATATACGCGATCGATTCGATAGCTAGCGNNNN &amp;gt;2_name ACGTTGCGGCATTCGATCGACGATCGATGCAAACGGTCACGGACTGACTGT ACACACGTAGCAGCATCAGCATATTCGATGGCATCGATACCGGTTGGACGG NNNNNNNNNNNNGGTGACACACGAGATATATFAGATCAACGTAAGGGATGA NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN AGTCGCTAGCATGCATGGCATATACGCGATCGATTCGATAGCTAGCGNNNN  There are two common formats for FASTA files:
- Single line FASTA
Each record consists of two line: a name line (starts with &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;) and a sequence line. - Multiline FASTA
Each records consists of multiple lines, First line is a name line (starts with &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;), followed by multiple lines of sequences.</description>

      <description>Recently Someone asked a question on reddit: Adding a row and a column that are means for a set matrix
This is a very simple problem that many of us learned how to do only a few hours in to basic R. But since I’ve been learning tidyverse package, I figured why not do it tidy-fashion?
Let’s give it a try.
Here is the question:
 I have the following sequence:</description>
