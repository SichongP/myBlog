      <description>In my work, we often need to visualize the location of a set of variants in a genome. When you have a dozen variants, it’s usually not too bad to go through them manually and place them on chromosomes. However, as the number of variants grow, it gets annoying very quickly!
Like most of you working on non-model organisms, I have long been jealousy of human geneticists’ ability to quickly draw a fancy karyotype plot (among other things).</description>

      <description>What is Bioinformatics without Biologists?When I first joined a genetics lab in grad school, my first task was to analyze a set of variants. Now this may sound idiot-proof to you. But imagine the intimidation of a gigantic text file with a not-so-intuitive format (VCF) on a not-so-fool-frieldly command line interface to someone who spent the majority of their undergrad education learning about how molecules work with each other or how peas can be smooth or wrinkle.</description>
