      <description>At the moment of writing this post, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on the plane flying to Cornell. There I will learn a beautiful technique called Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing, or ChRO-seq.
Thirteen hours of travel is getting to the point of breaking my soul &amp;ndash; I have finished most of work I can comfortablely do with one screen on a samll laptop. So I decided to write down what I know so far about ChRO-seq in preparation for my upcoming training tomorrow.</description>
