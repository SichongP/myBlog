      <description>Why multiple testing correction? Multiple testing refers to a practice where we apply the same statistical test independantly multiple times. This raises a problem that’s related to hypothesis testing: the more independant tests we do, the more inflated our false positive rate becomes. Here I’m gonna use a simple example to explain why multiple testing correction is crucial for hypothesis testing.

This is a very simple problem that many of us learned how to do only a few hours in to basic R. But since I’ve been learning tidyverse package, I figured why not do it tidy-fashion?
Let’s give it a try.
Here is the question:
 I have the following sequence:</description>
